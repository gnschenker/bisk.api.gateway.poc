= API Gateway

We have:

* An *API gateway* listening at http://localhost:7000
* The routing is defined in the file `ocelot.json` in the `ApiGateway` project
* An *application management* microservice listening at `http://application-management:6000` with the following endpoints
** `/api/applications`
** `/api/applications/{applicationId}`
* A *programs selection* microservice listening at `http://product-selection:5000` with the following endpoints
** `/api/programs`
** `/api/programs/{programId}`
* The API Gateway reroutes requests:
** to `/applications` and `/applications/{applicationId}` to the *application management* microservice
** to `/programs` and `/programs/{programId}` to the *programs selection* microservice

== Running the application

. Navigate to this solution folder 
. Execute the following command to run the application:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose up -d --build
--

. Double check that the app is up and running:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose ps
--

. Open another terminal window and navigate to this solution folder
. Follow the logs of the `gateway` component:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose logs -f gateway
--

== Testing the application

. Open another terminal window
. Make sure that the gateway is responding:
+
[source]
--
curl http://localhost:7000/api/values
--
+
it should reply with:
+
[source]
--
value1, value2
--

. Try to access the `applications` and `programs` in their respective microservice:
+
[source]
--
# this will be re-routed to http://application-management:6000/api/applications
curl http://localhost:7000/applications

# this will be re-routed to http://program-selection:5000/api/programs
curl http://localhost:7000/programs
--


. Also try to get a single application or program:
+
[source]
--
curl http://localhost:7000/applications/12
curl http://localhost:7000/programs/5
--

== Tear down application

. To tear down the application execute:
+
[source]
--
docker-compose down -v
--
